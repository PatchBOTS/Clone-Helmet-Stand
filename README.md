# Clone Helmet Stand Cog
### Please Read Before Downloading 3D File

## CODE
### Adafruit NeoPixel "Simple" Sketch.   
I just modified the color of the sketch to 100,100,255. And modified the delay time from 500ms to 200ms.  That's it! 

## 3D Files
The 3D files are free for download.  This files were built for MY helmet stand which is an unmodified Woodchuck helmet stand received in August 2018. I can't gaurantee yours will be exactly the same. 
I'm happy to distribute these files for free but they are not guaranteed to work.  I am very big on the "print quick and dirty and fix later" philosophy, so there may be some physical editing to the parts needed which I did not document.
